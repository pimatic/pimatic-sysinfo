    * Improved error handling on device initialization, replaced 
      assertion with more meaningful error handling

      but is not supported.
    * Added new monitoring capabilities: 
        * Memory usage (percent): `"memoryUsedPercent"`
        * Memory free (bytes): `"memoryFree"`
        * Memory free (percent): `"memoryFreePercent"`
        * Number of processes: `"processes"`
        * System temperature (Fahrenheit â„‰): `"temperatureF"`
        * WiFi received signal level (dBm): `wifiSignalLevel` 
        * Network interface throughput received (bps): `nwThroughputReceived` 
        * Network interface throughput sent (bps): `nwThroughputSent` 
        * Pimatic process uptime (seconds): `"pimaticUptime"`
     * Renamed some attributes. Device configuration will be transformed automatically, 
       but rules and variables need to be adapted manually. See README.md for details.
